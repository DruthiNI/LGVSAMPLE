This paper presents a novel smart FFT (SFFT) algorithm, which reduces the computation time by selecting a subset of the big data (undersampling the ADC data by a factor of 9) and processes the data using the SFFT to decrease the frequency separation and detect signal more accurately based on no priori knowledge. Instead of 32,768 point FFT, 4,096 pt. FFT used in SFFT can achieve better performance in significantly less computation. This SFFT technique boon the frequency separation to equal the frequency resolution.
