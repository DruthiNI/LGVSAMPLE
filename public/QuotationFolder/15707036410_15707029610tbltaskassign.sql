With VTCP-ABE, the patient can enforce fine-grained access control over his/her PHI in a cryptographical way. Before submitting the encrypted PHI to the eHealth cloud decryption server, a pre-process on the ciphertext and transmission key is employed to preserve the identity privacy of the physician. The correctness of returned ciphertext can be efficiently verified. Moreover, the malicious physician who leaks the private key can be precisely tracked. Besides, we extend the proposed VTCP-ABE to support the delegation property, with which a resource-limited physician can authorize someone else to obtain a partial decrypted ciphertext without exposing the PHI content. The security of VTCP-ABE is proved in the selective model.
